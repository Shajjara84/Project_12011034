# NLP Sentiment Analysis Project

This project aims to apply natural language processing (NLP) techniques to classify the sentiment of tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic. By analyzing and categorizing the sentiments expressed in these tweets, I can gain valuable insights into public opinion and trends surrounding the pandemic.

# Project Structure
The project is divided into several tasks:
Selection of an Appropriate Data (Data Collection): I select a suitable dataset of labeled tweets related to COVID-19 from the Kaggle website.

Text Preprocessing: I clean and transform the text data using various techniques such as removing punctuation, stop words, and stemming.

Text Representation: I apply techniques like POS tagging, word embeddings, and N-grams to represent the text data in a suitable format for analysis.

Text Classification / Prediction: I use Decision Tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers to classify the sentiment of the tweets.
